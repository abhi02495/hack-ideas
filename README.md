1. Download the repo and run the below command in the project terminal to install the node modules

3. Sign In with any Employee ID. I have used 'BD5075' as example and click on Submit.

Example form filled - (**Make sure to fill the organizer detail same as the Employee ID so that you get delete privilege of the Event as well**)
